## Technology behing the Angotia Resources API

### Backend
- **Elixir** - Rapid, multi concurrent language - a brilliant fit for an API which need to handle a lot of concurrent requests.
- **Ecto** - Set up tools to work with SQL database. Without it, I would need to write them by hand.
- **Absinthe** - This API can be used in a variety of ways, so using GraphQL seems like a natural choice to transfer responsibility for API responses to the client side. Thanks to that, Resources API is flexible for another microservices.

### Database
- **PostgreSQL** - The choice of SQL database was brilliant. The game stores a lot of data that is consistent and predictable. In this case, PostgreSQL benefit from the *ACID* model and *distributed transactions*.
